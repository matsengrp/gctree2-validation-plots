This directory contains scripts for benchmarking the newest version of gctree,
using Duncan's bcr-phylo simulations.

Running the scripts in this repo requires a python environment with `gctree`
installed.
Then to produce the plots run `gctree_benchmark_direct_run.sh`.
The filepaths in that file will need to be modified to point toward simulations
and gctree runs produced by running the following: https://github.com/psathyrella/partis/blob/dev/bin/run-paired-loci.sh#L28
